# Real-Time Grayscale Video Filter with OpenCV

This script captures video from your webcam and applies a grayscale filter to each frame in real-time using OpenCV. The filtered video is displayed in a window, and you can exit the video stream by pressing the 'd' key.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV library (cv2)

## Installation

1. **Install Python 3.x**: Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

2. **Install OpenCV**: Install the OpenCV library using pip if you haven't already.


This `README.md` file provides a clear and concise explanation of how to use the script, including installation instructions, a script description, the complete script for reference, and additional information on how to exit the video stream.
